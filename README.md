# Project goal
The goal of this project is to create a dog breed identification application using convolutional neural networks. The resulting algorithm could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of the finished project.
